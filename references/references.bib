@article{Mielle2017,
    abstract = {How to divide floor plans or navigation maps into a semantic representation, such as rooms and corridors, is an important research question in fields such as human-robot interaction, place categorization, or semantic mapping. While most algorithms focus on segmenting robot built maps, those are not the only types of map a robot, or its user, can use. We have developed a method for segmenting maps from different modalities, focusing on robot built maps and hand-drawn sketch maps, and show better results than state of the art for both types. Our method segments the map by doing a convolution between the distance image of the map and a circular kernel, and grouping pixels of the same value. Segmentation is done by detecting ripple like patterns where pixel values vary quickly, and merging neighboring regions with similar values. We identify a flaw in segmentation evaluation metric used in recent works and propose a more consistent metric. We compare our results to ground-truth segmentations of maps from a publicly available dataset, on which we obtain a better Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) than state of the art with 0.98 compared to 0.85 for a recent Voronoi-based segmentation method and 0.78 for the DuDe segmentation method. We also provide a dataset of sketches of an indoor environment, with two possible sets of ground truth segmentations, on which our method obtains a MCC of 0.82 against 0.40 for the Voronoi-based segmentation method and 0.45 for DuDe.},

    abstract = {The robot space is a ubiquitous environment in which the networked robot plays the role of main mediator that accepts the sensor data from the environment, interprets the data to understand the situation, and decides the actions to perform. Semantic robot space provides the high-level data model of the robot space that enables context-aware service execution. We designed the semantic robot space based on the semantic Web technology, which provided crucial advantages in architecting dynamic reconfiguration mechanism. The standard nature of the technology leverages the interaction among stake-holders in building robot spaces, which makes it possible to establish public registry-based construction of the semantic robot space. We conclude that semantic robot space based on the semantic Web not only embellishes the intelligence of robots but also reduces the cost of installing and maintaining robot spaces.},

@article{Cadena2016,
abstract = {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)consists in the concurrent construction of a model of the environment (the map), and the estimation of the state of the robot moving within it. The SLAM community has made astonishing progress over the last 30 years, enabling large-scale real-world applications, and witnessing a steady transition of this technology to industry. We survey the current state of SLAM. We start by presenting what is now the de-facto standard formulation for SLAM. We then review related work, covering a broad set of topics including robustness and scalability in long-term mapping, metric and semantic representations for mapping, theoretical performance guarantees, active SLAM and exploration, and other new frontiers. This paper simultaneously serves as a position paper and tutorial to those who are users of SLAM. By looking at the published research with a critical eye, we delineate open challenges and new research issues, that still deserve careful scientific investigation. The paper also contains the authors' take on two questions that often animate discussions during robotics conferences: Do robots need SLAM? and Is SLAM solved?},

This paper shows how probabilistic estimation problems can be transformed into a set estimation problem by assuming that some rare events will never happen. Since the probability of occurrence of those rare events can be computed, we can give some prior lower bounds for the probability associated to solution set of the corresponding set estimation problem. The approach will be illustrated on a parameter estimation problem.},
