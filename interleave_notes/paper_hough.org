  - for extraction of shapes like ellipses, circles or lines
  - detect a given geometrical shape and return the parameters of it
    - e.g. two coordinates of the center and the radius for a circle
  - first steps: preprocessing and edge detection
  - principle: compute the modulus of the gradient of the image && to
    treshold the resulting gradient image

  - problem of parameter estimation can be cast into the problem of
    characterizing a set with all parameter vectors that are
    consistent with the ith measurement vector.
  - p = parameter vector, [y](i) = ith measurement box
  - problem considered to be implicit for the use of implicit equation
    f(p,y) = 0
  - considering that y can be isolated so that g(p) = y -> the problem
    becomes a set inversion problem
  - example: find parameter vector p = (p1,p1)^T such that
    20*exp(-p1^t)-8*exp(-p2^t) goes trough all boxes in fig4 -> model
    function is f(p,y) = 20*exp(-p1*y1)-8*exp(-p2*y1) - y2
  - shape function = f : {\real^nf X \real^2 -> \real^nf
                          (p,y)   -> f(p,y)
  - the shape associated to *p* is defined as: S(*p*) = {y \in \real^2, f(p,y) =
    0}
  - considering the set of (small) boxes in the image Y  =
    {[y](1),...,[y](m)}, each of this box is assumed to intersect the
    edge of the shape which extraction is wanted
    - e.g. in a buoy Y corresponds to a small boxes with cented the
      edge points and with width of 2 pixels
    - as the circle is the objective, the shape fcuntion is: f(p,y) =
      (y1 - p1)^2 + (y2 - p2)^2 - p3^2 and the parameter vector is *p* =
      (p1, p2, p3)^T with p1 and p2 being the coordinates of the circle
      and p3 its radius.
  - the feasible set P is the set of all *p* such that the
      corresponding shape crosses all boxes [y](i)
  - in a normal situation many boxes do not correspond to the shape
    and should be considered as outliers and that has to be fixed for
    a non-empy set

  -  interval approach consistente with infinite number of probability
    distribuitions
  - if [x1] = [-\infty, 5], [x2] = [-\infty, 4] and [x3] = [6, \infty], and x3 = x1 +
    x2, the following contractions can be made:
    - x3 = x1 + x2 \Rightarrow z \in [6,\infty]  \cap ([-\infty,5] + [-\infty,4]) = [6,\infty]  \cap [-\infty, 9] = [6,9]
    - x1 = x3 - x2 \Rightarrow x \in [-\infty,5] \cap ([6,\infty]  - [-\infty,4]) = [-\infty,5] \cap [2,\infty] = [2,5]
    - x2 = x3 - x1 \Rightarrow y \in [-\infty,4] \cap ([6,\infty]  - [-\infty,5]) = [-\infty,4] \cap [1,\infty] = [1,4]
  - the contractions are peformed until no more change can be observed

  - interval propagation method converges to a box wich contains all
    solution vectors of the set of constraints
  - empy set \rightarrow no solution
  - result is the same for any order of contractions but it's
    execution time is sensitive to it
  - /forward-backward propagation/ is an efficient method
  - 4
  - the q-relaxed intersection of m boxes is not necessarily a box
  - q-relaxed feasible set P^{{q}}
    - for each /i/ it is first enclosed the sets *[p]* \cap Pi by boxes
   [p](i)
    - it is computed the q-relaxed intersection of those boxes and then
    a box encolsure for it
    - now it is on the same situation as it started, still enclosing
     P^{{q}} but with a smaller box
    - the process is repeated until the solution is stable
  - another view to compute the box for the q-relaxed intersection
    - for each set inside the *[p]* box, it is computed the smallest box
      containing each [p](i)
    - it is computed a box containing the q-relaxed intersection of
      the [p](i)'s 
    - that resulting box is bisected into two smaller boxes and the
      process is repeated
